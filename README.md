# Data Scientist Apprenticeship
## TA Recruitment

This repository contains some supporting files for a teaching session in data science

* `get_rainfall.ipynb` is a notebook demonstrating how to use an API to download data from the Environment Agency
* `Station.py` is a class which encapsulates the data and behaviour of a Monitoring Station
* `get_readings_with_oo.ipynb` is a simple notebook which uses Station.py and which can be extended as you wish.
* `StationTest` is a standalone program which does the same as `get_readings_with_oo.ipynb`


Students have been given a lab exercise to help them learn about python and using a REST API.  A student has trouble getting their code to work.  Your task will be to provide assistance to them through Microsoft Teams.  They will share their screen with you.  You may wish to familiarise yourself with this functionality before the session.

Familiarise yourself with the contents of the GitHub repository and prepare to support the student during the interview session.

Good Luck.
